BFS:
- Finds shortes path between two nodes in tree/graph. But it does not allows weighted graph.




Bellman-Ford Algorithm:
Finds shortes path. The worst case for Belmond Ford algorithm is usually a time complexity of O(n^2). So it's not very efficient.

Dijkstra Algorithm:
- Finds shortes path. Dijkstra's algorithm, on the other hand, is a little bit faster than that and a little bit more efficient with the downside that it can't accommodate for negative weights between notes.
